                     Version 3, 29 June 2007\r\n\
           Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc\r\n\r\n\
TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n\
0. Definitions.\r\n\r\n\
\"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU \r\n\
General Public License.\r\n\r\n\
\"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other \r\n\
kinds of works, such as semi-conductor masks.\r\n\r\n\
\"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under \r\n\
this License. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \r\n\
\"Licensees\" and \"recipients\" may be individuals or \r\n\
organizations.\r\n\r\n\
To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of \r\n\
the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other \r\n\
than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called \r\n\
a \"modified version\" of the earlier work or a work \"based on\" \r\n\
the earlier work.\r\n\r\n\
A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a \r\n\
work based on the Program.\r\n\r\n\
To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, \r\n\
without permission, would make you directly or secondarily \r\n\
liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except \r\n\
executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. \r\n\
Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without \r\n\
modification), making available to the public, and in some \r\n\
countries other activities as well.\r\n\r\n\
To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that \r\n\
enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere \r\n\
interaction with a user through a computer network, with no \r\n\
transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\r\n\r\n\
An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal \r\n\
Notices\" to the extent that it includes a convenient and \r\n\
prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate \r\n\
copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no \r\n\
warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties \r\n\
are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this \r\n\
License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface \r\n\
presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, \r\n\
a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\r\n\r\n\
1. Source Code.\r\n\r\n\
The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the \r\n\
work for making modifications to it. \"Object code\" means any \r\n\
non-source form of a work.\r\n\r\n\
A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an \r\n\
official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, \r\n\
in the case of interfaces specified for a particular \r\n\
programming language, one that is widely used among \r\n\
developers working in that language.\r\n\r\n\
The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, \r\n\
other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the \r\n\
normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is \r\n\
not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to \r\n\
enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to \r\n\
implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation \r\n\
is available to the public in source code form. A \"Major \r\n\
Component\", in this context, means a major essential \r\n\
component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific \r\n\
operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, \r\n\
or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code \r\n\
interpreter used to run it.\r\n\r\n\
The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form \r\n\
means all the source code needed to generate, install, and \r\n\
(for an executable work) run the object code and to modify \r\n\
the work, including scripts to control those activities. \r\n\
However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or \r\n\
general-purpose tools or generally available free programs \r\n\
which are used unmodified in performing those activities \r\n\
but which are not part of the work. For example, \r\n\
Corresponding Source includes interface definition files \r\n\
associated with source files for the work, and the source \r\n\
code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms \r\n\
that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by \r\n\
intimate data communication or control flow between those \r\n\
subprograms and other parts of the work.\r\n\r\n\
The Corresponding Source need not include anything that \r\n\
users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the \r\n\
Corresponding Source.\r\n\r\n\
The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is \r\n\
that same work.\r\n\r\n\
2. Basic Permissions.\r\n\r\n\
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of \r\n\
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the \r\n\
stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your \r\n\
unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output \r\n\
from running a covered work is covered by this License only if \r\n\
the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This \r\n\
License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other \r\n\
equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\r\n\r\n\
You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not \r\n\
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise \r\n\
remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for \r\n\
the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively \r\n\
for you, or provide you with facilities for running those \r\n\
works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License \r\n\
in conveying all material for which you do not control \r\n\
copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for \r\n\
you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction \r\n\
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any \r\n\
copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship \r\n\
with you.\r\n\r\n\
Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely \r\n\
under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not \r\n\
allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\
3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention \r\nLaw.\r\n\r\n\
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective \r\n\
technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling \r\n\
obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty \r\n\
adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting \r\n\
or restricting circumvention of such measures.\r\n\r\n\
When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power \r\n\
to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent \r\n\
such circumvention is effected y exercising rights under this \r\n\
License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim \r\n\
any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a \r\n\
means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third \r\n\
parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological \r\n\
measures.\r\n\r\n\
4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\r\n\r\n\
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code \r\n\
as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you \r\n\
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an \r\n\
appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating \r\n\
that this License and any non-permissive terms added in \r\n\
accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices \r\n\
of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of \r\n\
this License along with the Program.\r\n\r\n\
You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you \r\n\
convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for\r\n\
a fee.\r\n\r\n\
5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\r\n\r\n\
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the \r\n\
modifications to produce it from the Program, in the \r\n\
form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided \r\n\
that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n\r\n\
     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you \r\n\
modified it, and giving a relevant date.\r\n\r\n\
     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it \r\n\
is released under this License and any conditions added \r\n\
under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement \r\n\
in section 4 to \"keep intact all notices\".\r\n\r\n\
     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this \r\n\
License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This \r\n\
This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable \r\n\
section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its \r\n\
parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License \r\n\
gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but \r\n\
it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately  \r\n\
received it.\r\n\r\n\
     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must \r\n\
display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program \r\n\
has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal \r\n\
Notices, your work need not make them do so.\r\n\r\n\
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and \r\n\
independent works, which are not by their nature extensions \r\n\
of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such \r\n\
as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or \r\n\
distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the \r\n\
compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit \r\n\
the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond \r\n\
what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work \r\n\
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the \r\n\
other parts of the aggregate.\r\n\r\n\
6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\r\n\r\n\
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the \r\n\
terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey \r\n\
the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of \r\n\
this License, in one of these ways:\r\n\r\n\
     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical \r\n\
product (including a physical distribution medium), \r\n\
accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable \r\n\
physical medium customarily used for software interchange.\r\n\r\n\
     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical \r\n\
product (including a physical distribution medium), \r\n\
accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years \r\n\
and valid for for as long as you offer spare parts or customer \r\n\
support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses \r\n\
the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source \r\n\
for all the software in the product that is covered by this \r\n\
License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for \r\n\
software interchange, for a price no more than your \r\n\
reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying \r\n\
of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source \r\n\
from a network server at no charge.\r\n\r\n\
     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy  \r\n\
of thewritten offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This \r\n\
alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, \r\n\
 and only if you received the object ode with such an offer, in \r\n\
accord with subsection 6b.\r\n\r\n\
     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a \r\n\
designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent \r\n\
access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the\r\n\
same placeat no further charge. You need not require recipients \r\n\
to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. \r\n\
If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the \r\n\
Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated \r\n\
by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying\r\n\
facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the \r\n\
object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. \r\n\
Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, \r\n\
you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as \r\n\
long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\r\n\r\n\
     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, \r\n\
provided you inform other peers where the object code and \r\n\
Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the \r\n\
general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\r\n\r\n\
A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is \r\n\
excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need \r\n\
not be included in conveying the object code work.\r\n\r\n\
A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which \r\n\
means any tangible personal property which is normally used for\r\n\
personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything \r\n\
designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In \r\n\
determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful \r\n\
cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular \r\n\
product received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers \r\n\
to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless \r\n\
of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the \r\n\
particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, \r\n\
the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of \r\n\
whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or \r\n\
non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only \r\n\
significant mode of use of the product.\r\n\r\n\
\"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any \r\n\
methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information \r\n\
required to install and execute modified versions of a \r\n\
covered work in that User Product from a modified version of \r\n\
its Corresponding SourceThe information must suffice to \r\n\
ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object \r\n\
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely \r\n\
because modification has been made.\r\n\r\n\
If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, \r\n\
or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying \r\n\
occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession \r\n\
and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in \r\n\
perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction \r\n\
is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under \r\n\
this section must be accompanied by the Installation \r\n\
Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you \r\n\
nor any third party retains the ability to install modified \r\n\
object code on the User Product (for example, the work has \r\n\
been installed in ROM).\r\n\r\n\
The requirement to provide Installation Information does not \r\n\
include a requirement to continue to provide support service, \r\n\
warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or \r\n\
installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it \r\n\
has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be \r\n\
denied when the modification itself materially and adversely \r\n\
affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and \r\n\
protocols for communication across the network.\r\n\r\n\
Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation provided, in\r\n\
accord with this section Information must be in a format that \r\n\
is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to \r\n\
the public in source code form), and must require no special \r\n\
password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\r\n\r\n\
7. Additional Terms.\r\n\r\n\
\"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms \r\n\
of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its \r\n\
conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the \r\n\
entire Program shall be treated as though they were included \r\n\
in this License, to the extent that they are valid under \r\n\
applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part \r\n\
of the Program, that part may be used separately under those \r\n\
permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this \r\n\
License without regard to the additional permissions.\r\n\r\n\
When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your \r\n\
option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or \r\n\
from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to \r\n\
require their own removal in certain cases when you modify \r\n\
the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, \r\n\
added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give \r\n\
appropriate copyright permission.\r\n\r\n\
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for\r\n\
material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized \r\n\
by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms \r\n\
of this License with terms:\r\n\r\n\
     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from \r\n\
the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\r\n\r\n\
     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal \r\n\
notices or author attributions in that material or in the \r\n\
Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or\r\n\r\n\
     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that \r\n\
material, or requiring that modified versions of such material \r\n\
be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original \r\n\
version; or\r\n\r\n\
     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of \r\n\
licensors or authors of the material; or\r\n\r\n\
     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of \r\n\
some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\r\n\r\n\
     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that \r\n\
material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions \r\n\
of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, \r\n\
for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly \r\n\
impose on those licensors and authors.\r\n\r\n\
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \r\n\
\"further restrictions\" within the meaning of section 10. If the \r\n\
Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a \r\n\
notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a \r\n\
term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. \r\n\
If a license document contains a further restriction but permits \r\n\
relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a\r\n\
covered work material governed by the terms of that license \r\n\
document, provided that the further restriction does not \r\n\
survive such relicensing or conveying.\r\n\r\n\
If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, \r\n\
you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the \r\n\
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating \r\n\
where to find the applicable terms.\r\n\r\n\
Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be \r\n\
stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated \r\n\
as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way. \r\n\r\n\
8. Termination.\r\n\r\n\
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as \r\n\
expressly provided under this License. Any attempt to \r\n\
propagate or modify it is void, and will otherwise automatically \r\n\
terminate your rights under this License including any patent \r\n\
licenses granted (under the third paragraph of section 11).\r\n\r\n\
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your \r\n\
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) \r\n\
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly \r\n\
and finally terminates your license, and  (b) permanently, if \r\n\
the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some \r\n\
reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\r\n\r\n\
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is \r\n\
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of \r\n\
the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time \r\n\
you have received notice of violation of this License (for any \r\n\
work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation \r\n\
prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\r\n\r\n\
Termination of your rights under this section does not \r\n\
terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies \r\n\
or rights from you under this License. If your rights have \r\n\
been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not \r\n\
qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under \r\n\
section 10.\r\n\r\n\
9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\r\n\r\n\
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive \r\n\
or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a \r\n\
covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using \r\n\
peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does \r\n\
not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this \r\n\
License grants you permission to propagate or modify any \r\n\
covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not \r\n\
accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a \r\n\
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License \r\n\
to do so.\r\n\r\n\
10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\r\n\r\n\
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient \r\n\
automatically receives a license from the original licensors, \r\n\
to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this \r\n\
License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by \r\n\
third parties with this License.\r\n\r\n\
An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control \r\n\
control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, \r\n\
or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If \r\n\
propagation of a covered work results from an entity \r\n\
transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy \r\n\
of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the \r\n\
party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the \r\n\
previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the \r\n\
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in \r\n\
interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with \r\n\
reasonable efforts.\r\n\r\n\
You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise \r\n\
of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For \r\n\
example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other \r\n\
charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and \r\n\
you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or \r\n\
counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is \r\n\
infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or \r\n\
importing the Program or any portion of it.\r\n\r\n\
11. Patents.\r\n\r\n\
A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under \r\n\
this License of the Program or a work on which the Program  \r\n\
isbased. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's \r\n\
\"contributor version\".\r\n\r\n\
A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims \r\n\
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already \r\n\
acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by \r\n\
some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or \r\n\
selling its contributor version, but do not include claims \r\n\
that would be infringed only as a consequence of further \r\n\
modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this \r\n\
definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant patent \r\n\
sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of \r\n\
this License.\r\n\r\n\
Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, \r\n\
royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential \r\n\
patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import \r\n\
and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its \r\n\
contributor version.\r\n\r\n\
In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any \r\n\
express agreement or commitment, however denominated, \r\n\
not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to \r\n\
practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). \r\n\
To \"grant\" such a patent license to a party means to make \r\n\
such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent \r\n\
against the party.\r\n\r\n\
If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent \r\n\
license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not \r\n\
available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the \r\n\
terms of charge and under the terms of this License, through \r\n\
a publicly available network server or other readily accessible \r\n\
means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding \r\n\
Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of \r\n\
the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) \r\n\
arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this \r\n\
License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. \r\n\
\"Knowingly relying\" means you have actual knowledge that, \r\n\
but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a \r\n\
country, or your recipient's use of the covered work ina country, \r\n\
would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country \r\n\
that you have reason to believe are valid.\r\n\r\n\
If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or \r\n\
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring \r\n\
conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to \r\n\
some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing \r\n\
them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of \r\n\
the covered work, then the patent license you grant is \r\n\
automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work \r\n\
and works based on it.\r\n\r\n\
A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include \r\n\
within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is \r\n\
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights \r\n\
that are specifically granted under this License. You may not \r\n\
convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement \r\n\
with a third party that is in the business of distributing \r\n\
software, under which distributing software, under which you \r\n\
make payment to the third party based on the extent of your \r\n\
activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party \r\n\
grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered \r\n\
work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in \r\n\
connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you \r\n\
(or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in \r\n\
connection with specific products or compilations that contain \r\n\
the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or \r\n\
that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\r\n\r\n\
Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or \r\n\
limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement \r\n\
that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent \r\n\
law.\r\n\r\n\
12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\r\n\r\n\
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, \r\n\
agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this \r\n\
License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this \r\n\
License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to \r\n\
satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License \r\n\
and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence \r\n\
you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to \r\n\
terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further \r\n\
conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the \r\n\
only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License \r\n\
would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\r\n\r\n\
13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\r\n\r\n\
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have \r\n\
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work \r\n\
licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public \r\n\
License into a single combined work, and to convey the \r\n\
resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply \r\n\
to the part which is the covered work, but the special \r\n\
requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, \r\n\
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply t\r\n\
o the combination as such.\r\n\r\n\
14. Revised Versions of this License.\r\n\r\n\
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or \r\n\
new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to \r\n\
time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present \r\n\
present version, but may differ in detail to address new \r\n\
problems or concerns.\r\n\r\n\
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the \r\n\
Program specifies that a certain numbered version ofthe GNU \r\n\
General Public License \"or any later version\" applies to it, \r\n\
you have the option of following the terms and conditions \r\n\
either of that numbered version or of any later version \r\n\
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program \r\n\
does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public \r\n\
License, you may choose any version ever published by the \r\n\
Free Software Foundation.\r\n\r\n\
If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future \r\n\
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that \r\n\
proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently \r\n\
authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\r\n\r\n\
Later license versions may give you additional or different \r\n\
permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed \r\n\
on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing \r\n\
to follow a later version.\r\n\r\n\
15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\r\n\r\n\
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE \r\n\
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN \r\n\
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT \r\n\
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE \r\n\
PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, \r\n\
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT \r\n\
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF \r\n\
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR \r\n\
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND \r\n\
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD \r\n\
THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE \r\n\
COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR \r\n\
CORRECTION.\r\n\r\n\
16. Limitation of Liability.\r\n\r\n\
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR \r\n\
AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, \r\n\
OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS \r\n\
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO \r\n\
YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, \r\n\
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT \r\n\
OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM \r\n\
(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA \r\n\
BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED \r\n\
BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE \r\n\
PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), \r\n\
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN \r\n\
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n\
17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\r\n\r\n\
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided \r\n\
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their \r\n\
terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely \r\n\
approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in \r\n\
connection with the Program, unless a warranty or \r\n\
assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in \r\n\
return for a fee.\r\n\r\n\
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n"
